# Getting Started

## Setup

Now that you have `fission` installed, you need to set it up for your local machine. If this is your first time using fission or you are setting up a new machine, you'll want to run setup:

```bash
$ fission setup
Username: YOURNAME
Email: yourname@example.com
‚úÖ Registration successful!
```

And you're good to go! A private key has been generated for your machine, and placed in your local `~/config/fission` folder. This secures communication with the Fission services, and works similarly to how using an SSH key to connect to GitHub works.

Your first web address is based on your username, and looks like `USERNAME.fission.name`. You can add custom apps at `YOURAPP.fission.app`, and also add custom domains.
{% endhint %}

### Account Linking

If you already have an account, you'll want to link it to your local system. Just enter in your current username and [follow the linking flow](account-linking.md).

## Create a simple webpage

Let's create a simple website and make it interplanetary!

Create a project directory and add an `index.html` file:

```bash
$ mkdir hello-universe
$ cd hello-universe
$ touch index.html
```

Add some content to `index.html`:

{% code title="index.html" %}
```markup
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello Universe!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Universe!</h1>
    <p>This is a Fission powered page.</p>
    <p>Assisted by <a href="https://fission.codes">Fission</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

## Run IPFS

You need IPFS running in order to use `fission` 

If you're using [ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop), ensure that the application is running.

If you're running `ipfs` from the command line, run the following in a separate terminal:

```bash
$ ipfs daemon
```

## Go interplanetary!

Make sure you're in your project folder \(`hello-universe`\) and run:

```bash
$ fission up
üöÄ Now live on the network
üëå QmPmZDd6esqzsc2R1i8t5DcRGeRKrNomMhqj232Cz6heNW
üìù DNS Updated. Check out your site at:
üîó diffusiondemo.fission.name
```

Copy the url from the last line, and paste it into your web browser to see your new site, hosted on the decentralized web. It's that easy!

_Note: It may take some time for DNS to propagate. So give it a minute or two if it doesn't load immediately. If you're impatient you can also take the `content-id` from the CLI output and view it here at `https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipfs/{YOUR_CONTENT_ID}`_

{% hint style="success" %}
Fun IPFS Fact: If everyone follows this tutorial exactly you will end up with identical Content ID's. This means you can instantly pull the demo website from your neighbour if they're a step ahead of you.
