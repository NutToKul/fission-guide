## What is Fission?

Fission is a backend-as-a-service that gives you a serverless style of website and app building while also enabling you to run these systems from your local development environment.

We build on top of decentralized web technologies like the InterPlanetary File System \(IPFS\) to enable developer friendly features.

## Fission Live

Fission Live is the Fission service that lets you host your app — whether it’s a static website or a client side JavaScript front end — directly from your laptop.

Follow this guide to learn to use the CLI tool and experience seamless deployments to the decentralized web.
