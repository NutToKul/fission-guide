# Overview

## What is Fission?

Fission helps you quickly and easily publish files, websites, and apps directly from your local machine.

We enable a serverless style of website and app building. This supports local-first software that runs locally for you and your users as much as possible.

For front-end developers and designers, we provide a backend-as-a-service that includes user logins, end-to-end encryption, and user-controlled data.

Use the front-end frameworks you already know to quickly build front end features, and plug in these Fission features to power your app. Fission includes publishing tools and free subdomains to bring your websites and apps live.

Get started by installing the tools on your local machine.
